# Block-Based Programming Environment ðŸš€

## Overview

Welcome to the Block-Based Programming Environment, a creative space for coding and gaming activities. Developed using ReactJS, this project combines the simplicity of block-based coding with the versatility of popular games, providing an engaging learning experience.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS:** Powering the core functionality of the block-based programming environment.
- **react-router-dom:** For seamless navigation and routing within the application.
- **Firebase:** Handling authentication for login and signup features.

## Features

### Coding Activities

1. **Running Bird:**
   - Similar to the Chrome Dinosaur game, code the bird to run, duck, and jump using blocks in the workspace.
   
2. **Squirrel:**
   - Guide the squirrel to the endpoint, collecting carrots while avoiding webs.

3. **Sketch:**
   - Utilize the canvas to draw anything imaginable using blocks in the workspace.

4. **P5:**
